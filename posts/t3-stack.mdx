## Background

Hello! My name is Zachary and at this time I'm a recent college graduate from UCI. During my time in university I really didn't know what I was going to do with my degree.
University did allow my to explore different options where I can use my skills in programming, but was really glad to find out my last quarter of UCI which was Web Development.

I would say this was one of the most influential and pretty much worth my money classes. We built an eccommerce website where users are able to search, add to cart and buy movies.
We learned RESTful API's for querying and mutating JWT Tokens, Identity Managment, Billing, etc... using Spring Boot and MySQL for our backend and React for our frontend.
It was a solid class and shoutout to the TA's as they couldn't have taught it any better.

#### Beginning

Now that I graduated, I've been wanting to building more side projects on my own; however, the time it took to setup certain parts of what I've learned in that project course to me
seemed like a bummer. To be honest, if I put in the time to re-learn what I learned in that class I would've built more projects by now. To be honest, I think I'm happy where I'm at
because my curiosity was able to find other technologies that I think are actually really good.

The past three months or so, I actually started to do more research on Full Stack Development. I was overwhelmed with both the front and back end and was wasting my time on what new
technologies I should learn first. Luckily, I was able stubble upon a youtuber "[theo ping.gg](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheoBrowne1017)" who actually developed the T3-stack which is all of his favorite technologies in one.
He had one example where he built a website that compares two pokemons and allows users to vote on which one is the rounder. It really got hooked as it seemed really simple to learn.

Fortunately, there were also few youtubers ([TomDoesTech](https://www.youtube.com/c/TomDoesTech), [WebDevJunkie](https://www.youtube.com/c/WebDevJunkie)) that were able to help me understand the stack and
I saw the benefits of why it's a really useful stack to execute one's ideas. Here is how and what I learned, why I think it was useful and what I was able to build.

## What is T3-stack?

[T3-stack](https://github.com/t3-oss/create-t3-app) consists of Next.js, Tailwind CSS, tRPC, TypeScript, Prisma, NextAuth.js.

> The "T3 Stack" is a web development stack made by Theo focused on simplicity, modularity, and full-stack typesafety.

> #### What is it? Some Kind of Template?
>
> Kind of. We love the technologies that the T3 Stack includes but we do not believe that all of them are needed in every project.
> So we made create-t3-app to do one thing: Simplify complex boilerplate around the core T3 Stack tech without compromising the pieces modularity.

## How and What I learned

### Frontend

Not knowing where to start I chose to learn front-end because I really like to visually see my ideas come to light. I started off learning how to build portfolio websites which at this time learning
the popular technologies: React, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS.

Those were the main sources that I felt I've learned a lot especially the devaslife source. Him being a freelancer and actually building a website for a company was mind blowing.
Not knowing how websites worked seemed like magic but once you know the trick you know anything is possible.

### Backend

I mainly learned from people who where familiar with full stack development and were able to create a simple t3 tutorial on how all the technologies connect together. Prisma is an amazing
[ORM](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1279613/what-is-an-orm-how-does-it-work-and-how-should-i-use-one) for writing your schemas and obtaining data. For sure its good knowledge to
understand SQL language but simply just writing a simple ORM makes your life easier.

One of the amazing technologies used in this stack is NextAuth. The project course focused on user authentication for about 5 weeks. I was able to implement user authentication in less than a day.

Also, this stack uses [tRPC](https://trpc.io/docs/v10/) instead of [RESTful](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/api/what-is-a-rest-api) API's. From my understanding, simply it's remotely calling a function
from a server to query, mutate, delete data instead of calling and endpoint. RPC was really easy to write queries compared to REST; however, there is a draw back to scaleability wise which
I can accept.

Lastly, I think one of the best features is Typescript for both the front and back end. For me I'm used to type languages like C/C++ and Java. Being able to use it in Javascript
is something I feel is useful and many developers can agree typesafety is important in many aspects for one's project.

I came to realize that languages are just tools that can get the same job done. Obviously, each technology has their draw back and you must chose the consequences of each one.

From being able to build a project with this stack I think I was able to learn a lot based on how I needed to formulate ideas and what would be the most effective option like querying data.
