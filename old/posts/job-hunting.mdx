## Intro

Hola I'm Zack and I'm a recent graduate from UCI and looking for a job out of college. I just wanted to share certain tools I've used
I think would be useful for others who are students trying to find an internships or for those who just graduated needing some guidance
for job apps.

## Tools

These are the three main tools I feel like not a lot of people talk about but is insanely useful.

- [Simplify](https://simplify.jobs/)
- [Otta](https://otta.com/)
- [Notion](https://www.notion.so/)

### Simplify

[Simplify](https://simplify.jobs/) saved me the headache from applying through each job application manually.

It's a chrome extension and website that is to auto-fill applications and is able to show job listing applications.
It solved the problem of automation where it would save your most common data that would be used for a job application
and just auto-fill. I was definetly able to apply to more jobs than if I did it the traditional way.

Also, it's a place that will cater job listings for you where it actually brings you to the companys job listing website itself. I've used
indeed and other job listing website's where it may take you multiple steps until you actually make it to the company website.

### Otta

[Otta](https://otta.com/) is another website similar to Simplify but only for showing you jobs that cater to your experience.
Just fill out a mini questionaire and it will match you with many job applications.

It has added features where it's able to categories job listing base on what matches your experience similar to a dating app.

### Notion

Lastly, [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) is so useful because you can keep track of all your applications you've applied to.
It keeps track of the company, position, status, the job description, and when you applied.

[Here](https://www.notion.so/Job-Applications-b16804233c264fb684e421b4ffc0f6da) is my application with all the job links if yall are able
use it for this year.

I've used a ([template](https://www.notion.so/templates/job-applications)) provided by notion and this is all free.

## Conclusion

Take advantage of these tools as I wished I used them when I was in college. They are all free and really useful when applying for jobs.
